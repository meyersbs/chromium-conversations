            Software developers and testers have long struggled with how to
            elicit proactive responses from their coworkers when reviewing code
            for security vulnerabilities and errors. For a code review to be
            successful, it must not only identify potential problems but also
            elicit an active response from the colleague responsible for
            modifying the code. To understand the factors that contribute to
            this outcome, we analyze a novel dataset of more than one million
            code reviews for the Google Chromium project, from which we extract
            linguistic features of feedback that elicited responsive actions
            from coworkers. Using a manually-labeled subset of reviewer
            comments, we trained a highly accurate classifier to identify
            <em>'acted-upon'</em> comments (AUC = 0.85). Our results
            demonstrate the utility of our dataset, the feasibility of using
            NLP for this new task, and the potential of NLP to improve our
            understanding of how communications between colleagues can be
            authored to elicit positive, proactive responses.

            There are two datasets available for download. In each one, we have
            (to the best of our knowledge) de-identified all usernames and
            email addresses of developers involved in the Chromium Project. The
            datasets described below were exported from the PostgreSQL database
            used in our research. Everything needed to recollect and recreate
            our database is available <a href="https://github.com/andymeneely/sira-nlp/" target="_blank">here</a>.
            A <span>README.md</span> file, which explains the structure of the
            datasets, is included in the download below.
            <br><br>
            <span>CONVERSATIONS:</span> This is the full dataset containing
            over 1.5 million comments posted by developers reviewing proposed
            code changes. The dataset also includes the values we calculated for
            all nine linguistic features (described in Section 4 of the paper
            cited below).
            <br><br>
            <span>ANNOTATIONS:</span> This dataset is a subset of the
            <span>CONVERSATIONS</span> dataset. It contains the data used in
            the classification experiment outlined in Section 5 of the paper
            cited below (2,994 comments automatically identified as <em>acted-upon</em>
            and 800 comments manually identified as <em>not (known-to-be) acted-upon</em>).
